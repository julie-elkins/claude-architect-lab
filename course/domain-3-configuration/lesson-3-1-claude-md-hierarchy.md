# Lesson 3.1 — Where an instruction lives decides who gets it

**Domain 3: Claude Code Configuration & Workflows — 20% of CCAR-F**
**Task Statement 3.1:** Configure CLAUDE.md files with appropriate hierarchy, scoping,
and modular organization.

Lab artifact: the Course Doctor repository gets its instructions, split so that only the
relevant ones load.

## What you will be able to do afterwards

Diagnose why a teammate is not getting an instruction you wrote, and put it at the level
that fixes it — without guessing.

And one thing more important than any of the file paths: say, correctly, what a
`CLAUDE.md` can and cannot make happen.

## Why the exam cares

The guide puts this first in the domain, and its own stated skill is **"diagnosing
configuration hierarchy issues (e.g., a new team member not receiving instructions
because they're in user-level rather than project-level configuration)."**

Read that carefully, because it tells you the shape of the question. You will not be
asked to recite file paths. You will be given a symptom — someone is not getting a rule
— and asked which level it belongs at. The test is never "how important is this rule."
It is **"who does it apply to."**

Get it backwards and nothing errors. It applies to the wrong people, silently, which is
why it makes a good exam item and a bad afternoon.

## Fundamentals

Skip what you know. Here so a newcomer has somewhere to go and a senior gets the
one-line refresh.

**Configuration scope.** Whether a setting belongs to you, to this project, or to your
organisation. *Why it matters here:* scope is the entire subject of this task statement,
and nearly every mistake in it is a scope mistake. *Depth:* any tool with both a home
dotfile and a committed config — `git`, `ssh`, `editorconfig` — resolves the same way.

**Context versus control.** A *control* prevents an action. *Context* informs a
decision. *Why it matters here:* this is the distinction the lesson turns on, and the
documentation states it outright — see the build. *Depth:* `/docs/en/hooks-guide`, which
is where the controls live.

**Version control hygiene.** Which files belong in the repository, which belong only on
your machine, and which belong in neither. *Why it matters here:* it is what makes the
user/project split meaningful rather than cosmetic. *Depth:* `git`'s own `.gitignore`
documentation.

**Glob patterns.** `*`, `**` and `?` matching file paths; `src/**/*.py` is every Python
file at any depth under `src`. *Why it matters here:* `.claude/rules/` files select the
files they apply to with a glob. *Depth:* `man 7 glob`. Lesson 3.3 is the full treatment.

**Monolith versus modules.** One large instruction file against several focused ones
loaded as needed. *Why it matters here:* the guide names `.claude/rules/` as the
alternative to a monolithic `CLAUDE.md`, and the reason is token cost rather than
tidiness. *Depth:* Domain 5, where context budget is the subject.

## The idea, before any files

Three questions, in this order.

**Who does this apply to?** Only you, or everyone who clones the repository? That single
question picks the level, and it is the one the exam asks.

**Is it context, or is it a control?** This is the distinction that catches people, and
the documentation is unusually blunt about it:

> "Claude treats them as context, not enforced configuration. **To block an action
> regardless of what Claude decides, use a PreToolUse hook instead.**"

So a line in `CLAUDE.md` saying *never force-push* is a request. A hook is a refusal.
Writing the request and believing you installed the refusal is the most expensive
mistake available in this domain, and it fails quietly — nothing blocks, because nothing
was ever configured to block.

**When does it need to load?** Everything loaded costs context, and context spent is
unavailable for the work. An instruction that matters only when editing test files
should not load while you edit the API.

## The build

### Step 1 — the project instruction file

```
mkdir course-doctor && cd course-doctor
git init
printf '# Course Doctor\n\nPython 3.12+. Tests live in tests/.\n' > CLAUDE.md
```

Project instructions go at `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Either is the
project level; both are committed; everyone who clones gets them.

### Step 2 — know what loads, and when

Two behaviours to hold, because they are the ones the symptom questions rest on.

**Files in the hierarchy above your working directory load at launch. Files in
subdirectories load on demand.** So a `CLAUDE.md` three directories up is already in
context when the session starts, and one in `src/api/` arrives only when you touch
something there.

**A project file does not suppress a parent one — they combine.** This is worth
verifying yourself rather than believing, and it is verifiable: put a line in a parent
directory's `CLAUDE.md`, start a session in the child, and look. Both load.

### Step 3 — split the monolith

As the instruction file grows, move topic-specific material into `.claude/rules/`:

```
mkdir -p .claude/rules
```

A rules file carries frontmatter naming the paths it applies to, so it loads only when a
matching file is in play. `paths: ["tests/**/*"]` keeps your testing conventions out of
context while you are editing something else. Lesson 3.3 is the full treatment; what
matters here is that it is the documented alternative to one large file.

The guide also names **`@import`** for referencing external files to keep `CLAUDE.md`
modular — importing a standards file into each package's instructions. See the sources
note below: that syntax is in the exam guide and I have not yet located it in the
documentation, so it is listed as an objective and not yet taught here.

### Step 4 — look at what actually loaded

```
/memory
```

Browse and open the instruction files the session is working from. And `/status` is
worth a look for a different reason: **if an instruction file is over the recommended
length you get a warning at startup and in `/status`, and you also get one when several
files that are each fine add up past a combined limit.** Each `CLAUDE.md`, each rules
file and each `@path` import counts separately toward that.

That is a real failure mode: no single file looks wrong, and together they are too much.

## Tips

Things the documentation does not tell you.

**There is no precedence between user and project rules, and this is the one to
remember.** The documentation says it plainly: *"Neither set overrides the other: if a
user rule and a project rule conflict, Claude may follow either one, so keep the two
consistent."* Everyone assumes the more specific level wins. It does not. If you have a
conflict, you do not have a precedence puzzle — you have a bug, and the fix is to remove
the conflict.

**A rule on one laptop is a personal habit, not a team convention.** The next person
does not inherit it, and you will not find out until their work diverges from yours for
reasons neither of you can see.

**Your own preferences in the project file get imposed on everyone who clones.** The
mirror of the mistake above, and the more annoying one to be on the receiving end of.

**A subdirectory instruction file is the hardest one to find later.** When something is
applying and you cannot see where it came from, you check the project file first and a
nested one last. Knowing they exist is most of the fix.

**Four short files can breach the limit that none of them breaches alone.** The combined
warning is easy to miss at startup. `/status` is where you look on purpose.

## The anti-pattern

From the guide's own skill statement for this task statement, the named failure is:

> **A new team member not receiving instructions because they are in user-level rather
> than project-level configuration.**

And the broader shape, which the documentation's own wording hands you:

> **Treating context as if it were a control.**

An instruction file asks. A hook prevents. If what you need is a guarantee — a
destructive command refused, a prerequisite enforced — then `CLAUDE.md` is the wrong
tool no matter how firmly it is worded, and on exam day an option offering a hook will
beat an option offering stronger instructions.

## What this lesson does not cover

- **`.claude/rules/` frontmatter and glob semantics in depth** — lesson 3.3.
- **Skills and slash commands** — lesson 3.2.
- **Hooks.** Named here because the context/control distinction is meaningless without
  them, taught in Domain 1 TS 1.5.
- **Auto memory.** Claude writes its own notes alongside the instructions you write.
  Adjacent, real, and not in this task statement's objectives.
- **`AGENTS.md`.** The documentation says Claude Code can read it in place of or
  alongside project instructions, with a table per file combination. Not in the exam
  guide's objectives for TS 3.1, so it is out of scope here — and I have an unresolved
  note claiming a `CLAUDE.md` suppresses it entirely, which that table may contradict.
  Unresolved is recorded as unresolved.
- **`@import`** — an objective, not yet traced to documentation. See sources.

**Outstanding, and stated rather than papered over:**

- [ ] **`@import` syntax.** The exam guide lists it under TS 3.1. Searched the memory
      documentation on 2026-10-17 and did not find it. It may be on another page, named
      differently, or the guide and the docs may disagree. **Not taught until resolved** —
      teaching a syntax from memory is the failure this course is about.
- [ ] The `AGENTS.md` per-combination table, for the scope note above.

**Verified by running it, 2026-10-13**, and now corroborated by the documentation above —
recorded as `OBSERVED` first and upgraded rather than quietly restated:

- A project `CLAUDE.md` does **not** suppress a parent one. Both loaded together.
